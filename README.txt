To interact with the Game Engine, you need to provide a class that implements the PlayerTeam interface.

The Game Engine will call your chooseTeam function at the start of the game. The boolean teamOne variable tells you whether or not you are Team #1 or Team #2. (The input variable will be false if you are Team #2.) Additionally, the GameState that you are given will provide some basic information about the game setup including the size of the maze and the number of coins available. 

Each turn, the Game Engine will call your requestCommands function. You will be given a list of all Locations that you have information about. If a location is currently within scanner range of one of your robots, then you will have full information about this location (also, the isScanned function in the location will return true so you you can easily tell if a location is in scanner range of your robots). If a location is not in scanner range of one of your robots, then the location will only be in the list if a WolfBot, BatBot, or SkunkBot senses a Robot, Coin or Minotaur in that location. 

Your requestCommands function should return one Command object for each Robot in the robotsAwaitingCommand list. This list will typically include all of your robots, but in the case where a RabbitBot (or FalconBot) is getting an extra turn, it will only include the robots receiving this extra turn. (Similarly, a HippoBot will be missing from the list if the HippoBot just moved the previous turn.) If you decide not to return a Command for a particular Robot, that Robot will stand still and do nothing during the turn.
